  <p>Fair Work is a research project run by the <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford HCI Group</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Description</b>: Fair Work is a research system focused on fair pay for online workers. You can participate by completing this HIT and filling out the time self-report above. Worker responses will be aggregated and the system will automatically bonus workers to ensure that they earned minimum wage. It will log items such as worker time self-reports. Data will not be shared with anyone outside our research team. You can choose not to participate by not filling out the form. The system will still log that you completed the task so that you can receive a bonus. However, if no workers fill out the form, no bonuses will be sent because the system cannot estimate work time for the task.</p>

  <p><b>Time Involvement</b>: You can participate for as long as you want by filling out the form above on any HITs you encounter with it installed.</p>

  <p><b>Risks and Benefits</b>: Fair Work will supply bonuses based on aggregate worker reports. Beyond this, we cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from using Fair Work.</p>

  <p><b>Subject's Rights</b>: If you have read this form and have decided to participate in this project, please understand your participation is voluntary and you have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. The alternative is not to participate by filling out the form, or not completing this HIT. Your individual privacy will be maintained in all published and written data resulting from the study.</p>
