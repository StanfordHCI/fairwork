  <p>Fair Work is a research project run by the <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford HCI Group</a>.</p>

  <p>Description: Fair Work is a research system focused on fair pay for online workers. You can participate by using the Fair Work Javascript. The system will ask you for your AWS keys, and will display a timer self-report for workers in your tasks. Worker responses will be aggregated and the system will use your AWS keys to automatically bonus workers to ensure that they earned minimum wage. It will log items such as your HIT IDs, worker submissions for your HITs, and worker time self-reports. Your AWS keys and email will be stored encrypted, and only decrypted by the server when needed to perform these functions. Data will not be shared with anyone outside our research team. If you do not want our system escrowing your keys or tracking data or self reports for your tasks, you may run <a href="https://github.com/StanfordHCI/fairwork">an open-source version of the platform available on GitHub</a>.</p>

  <p>Time Involvement: You can participate for as long as you want by keeping the Javascript on your HITs.</p>

  <p>Risks and Benefits: Fair Work will spend money from your AWS account to bonus workers. This may accumulate to a substantial amount of money. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from using Fair Work.</p>
